/// How to visualise any thing 
This video outlines six tips and habits to help you improve your visualization skills, divided into short-term optimizations and long-term practices:

Short-Term Tips (Optimize existing visualization skills):

Focus on what's important (3:27): Avoid trying to visualize too much at once. Your mind's eye has a limited capacity, similar to your normal vision, where you focus on specific details while the rest fades. Concentrate only on the parts of the image or problem that are currently essential.
Think in 3D (4:48): Leverage your brain's ability to think in three dimensions. While most images are 2D, converting them to 3D allows you to represent more information in a compact way and view them from different angles, essentially expanding your mental capacity for free.
Work alongside physical images (5:52): It's acceptable to use physical drawings or reference points to guide your mental visualization, especially when you're less experienced. You can expand on these physical aids mentally, considering variations or details. Speaking your thoughts aloud (6:32) can also help maintain focus and clarity.

Long-Term Tips (Permanently improve visualization skills):

Gradually transition from physical to mental (6:40): Instead of immediately jumping into full mental visualization, start by gradually moving parts of an image from the physical realm into your mind. Test yourself to ensure these mental images persist and, over time, reduce your reliance on physical aids.
Explore and reflect on images (7:35): Deeply examine the images you create in your mind. Identify vague or unclear areas, understand what's missing or wrong (e.g., color, missing parts), and then work to expand on those details and fill in the gaps. This practice helps you naturally create more complex images over time.
Focus on speed (8:37): Practice visualizing quickly. The goal is to make mental imagery faster than physical drawing. Give yourself time constraints to scan and recreate images, and actively practice going through details and expanding on your mental images as rapidly as possible.
