//////////////////////////Reflection
-->Reflection means loocking inside your code(like classes, methods , properties) at runtime.
It allows your program to know about itself and work types and members dynamically - even if you  didn't hardcode them.

It's like your code holding a miror and saying,
"Hey, what classes, methods , or proprties do I have? Let me check and use them!"

//when to use
Used when your code needs to work with unknown types or flexible data.

code
class program
{
public string Name;
public string Age;
}

class Program
{
static void Main()
{
Type type = typeof(Person);

foreach(var prop in type.GetProperties())
{
 Console.WriteLine(prop.Name);
}
}
}
