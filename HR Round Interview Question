---
3. Action
👉 “To overcome this, I started prioritizing tasks better — first making sure the core functionality works, then improving it step by step. I also began discussing with my manager to confirm what level of detail was needed before starting.”


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
01:22​ - 1. Can you tell me something about yourself?

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////02:12​ - 2. Why do you want to work here?
✅ STAR Answer (Simple Version)
Situation:
I worked in my last company for about 5 years. I learned many things there — how to code, how to work with teams, and how to handle tasks.

Task:
But I saw that new tools and new technologies are coming in the market. If I stay with only old knowledge, I will not grow.

Action:
So, I started learning new skills and new technologies in my free time. I also improved how I talk with people and share ideas. Then I decided to look for a new role where I can use these new skills.

Result:
Now, I am ready to bring both my past 5 years of experience and my new skills to the next company, so I can do better work and also keep growing.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 5. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////6. Why should we hire you?
S (Situation):
In my previous role as a full stack .NET developer, we had a project where performance issues and bugs were delaying releases, and the client was unhappy.

T (Task):
I was responsible for fixing those performance problems, improving code quality, and making sure the product delivered business value on time.

A (Action):

I optimized stored procedures and queries, reducing database response time by 40%.

I used caching and state management in .NET Core and Angular to speed up the application.

I applied clean coding principles (like SOLID, design patterns) so the code became easier for my team to maintain.

I collaborated with testers, used tools like Azure DevOps/Jira for task tracking, and actively participated in Agile ceremonies (scrum, sprint planning, retrospectives).


R (Result):
Because of this, the application performance improved a lot, client satisfaction increased, and we were able to deliver features 2 weeks ahead of schedule.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////05:42​ - 7. Can you tell me about a time when you worked in a team?
🧩 S — Situation (What was happening?)

In my previous project, we were developing a Buy and Sell Property Application using .NET Core and Angular.
Our team had 5 members — 2 backend developers, 2 frontend developers, and 1 tester.
We had a tight deadline to deliver the property listing and booking module in 2 weeks.


---

🎯 T — Task (What was your role?)

My role was to integrate the frontend (Angular) with the backend APIs (.NET Core),
and make sure data like property details, prices, and owner info displayed correctly and updated in real time.


---

⚙️ A — Action (What did you do?)

I started by:

Coordinating daily with the backend team to finalize the API contracts.

Using Postman to test the APIs before integration.

Setting up Angular Interceptors for authentication.

Working closely with the tester to fix data binding and validation issues quickly.

Also helped another developer set up state management using a shared service.
---

🏁 R — Result (What happened finally?)

✅ We delivered the module 2 days before the deadline.
✅ There were zero major bugs during testing.
✅ The manager appreciated our team coordination and clear communication.
✅ This experience taught me how teamwork and open communication speed up delivery.


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////8. How do you handle criticism?
🧩 S – Situation
In one of my previous projects, during a code review, my senior pointed out that my API naming and exception handling could be more consistent with team standards.
---
🎯 T – Task
My task was to take that feedback positively, improve my code quality, and ensure the same mistake didn’t repeat in future development.
---

⚙️ A – Action

I didn’t take it personally — instead, I thanked him for the feedback.
Then I rechecked the project guidelines, updated my APIs as per standards, and added exception middleware for consistent error handling.
Later, I even created a small internal checklist so the team could review their own code before submitting.
---

🏆 R – Result

As a result, not only did my code quality improve, but my senior appreciated my attitude towards learning.
My approach helped reduce repeated review comments in our team and made delivery faster.


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////07:16​ - 9. How do you handle tight deadlines?
🧠 S – Situation
In my previous project (Buy & Sell Property Application), we had to deliver a major feature — the Payment Gateway Integration — within just 3 days because the client had an urgent demo scheduled.
---
🎯 T – Task
My responsibility was to complete the backend API and integrate it with the Angular frontend for real-time payment status updates — all within this short timeline.
---

⚙️ A – Action

Here’s how I handled it:

1. Prioritized the tasks — I first listed what was “must-have” vs “nice-to-have”.


2. Worked in focused sprints — I divided the 3 days into small goals (API first, UI next, testing last).


3. Collaborated closely — I stayed in touch with the frontend developer and QA team every few hours to fix issues quickly.


4. Avoided distractions — I turned off notifications and focused fully for 2-hour deep work sessions.


5. Used reusable code — leveraged existing modules and helper classes to save time.




---

🏆 R – Result

We successfully completed the integration within the deadline, and the client demo went smoothly.
Later, my manager appreciated my structured approach and teamwork under pressure.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 10. Can you tell me about a challenge you faced and how you overcame it?
⭐ S – Situation (What was happening)

In my previous project (Buy & Sell Property App), we faced a serious performance issue — the property listing page was taking 10–12 seconds to load because we were fetching too much data from the database at once.
---

🎯 T – Task (Your responsibility)

My task was to analyze and fix the performance problem so that the page would load faster, ideally in under 2 seconds, without breaking any existing functionality.
---
⚙️ A – Action (What you did)

1. I started by checking the SQL queries using SQL Profiler and found multiple joins and unnecessary columns being fetched.


2. I implemented pagination and filtering using LINQ and Stored Procedures — so only the required records were fetched.


3. I also added In-Memory Caching for repeated data like property categories and cities.
4. Finally, I worked with the frontend Angular team to implement a loading spinner and async data binding to make the experience smoother.
---
🏁 R – Result (What happened)

✅ The page load time dropped from 12 seconds to 1.8 seconds.
✅ API response improved by 80%.
✅ The business team appreciated that more users stayed on the page, which directly increased property view counts and user engagement.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////11. How do you prioritize your work?
🧩 S — Situation

In my previous project (Buy & Sell Property App), I had multiple tasks — fixing backend API bugs, adding a new payment feature, and helping the frontend team with integration — all with tight deadlines.


---

🎯 T — Task

My goal was to complete all these tasks efficiently without missing deadlines and without affecting code quality.


---

🛠️ A — Action

So, I did these things:

1. Listed all tasks and identified which ones had the highest business impact — for example, the payment feature was critical for release.


2. Discussed priorities with my project manager to confirm what should go first.


3. Used Azure Boards to plan my daily sprint tasks — breaking them into small steps.


4. Handled small, quick fixes (like minor UI bugs) during the gaps between major work.
5. If any blockers came, I immediately communicated to the team so that work didn’t get stuck.
---
✅ R — Result

Because of this structured approach:

The payment module was completed on time and successfully deployed.

The bug count dropped by 30%, and

My manager appreciated the way I handled priorities clearly and calmly.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 12. What motivates you?
S – Situation:
When I work on a project where I can solve real problems using technology — like in my Buy and Sell Property application, I had to improve how fast property data loads for users.
T – Task:
My goal was to make the system faster and smoother for buyers and sellers so that their experience feels professional — like a real enterprise app.
A – Action:
I optimized API calls, used caching, and debugged performance issues deeply.
I also learned new techniques (like asynchronous programming and caching) to make things efficient.

R – Result:
The result was that the page load time improved by more than 50%, and users started spending more time on the platform.
My manager appreciated my effort — and that feeling of creating real value really motivates me.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////Tell me about your self
"My name is Abhishek, and I have 4 years of experience as a Full Stack .NET Developer, working on end-to-end development of web applications using .NET Core, C#, Web API, Angular, SQL Server, and Azure.
On the backend, I work with .NET Core, EF Core, and Microservices, while on the frontend, I develop using Angular (latest versions), Bootstrap, and TypeScript. I also focus on SQL performance tuning, caching 
strategies, and secure authentication using JWT & OpenID Connect.
In my current project, a Buy & Sell Property Platform, I played a key role in building a real-time chat system with SignalR, a secure payments & transactions module, and admin dashboards with analytics. 
These features increased customer engagement by 30% and reduced manual efforts by 40%, making a direct business impact.
I actively participate in Agile ceremonies like scrum, sprint planning, and retrospectives, and collaborate closely with QA, testers, and DevOps. I also provide inputs on how technical choices
affect business outcomes such as performance, scalability, and customer satisfaction.
Along with development, I continuously upskill myself in system design, cloud (Azure), and performance tuning, and I mentor junior developers on best coding practices, debugging, and testing.
In short, I see myself not just as a developer who writes code, but as a problem-solver who aligns technology with business outcomes. That’s the mindset I bring to my work every day."
