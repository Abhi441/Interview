////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////What are your weaknesses ?
🌟 Example Weakness Answer (STAR Approach)
Weakness Chosen: "Sometimes I used to take more time in solving problems because I wanted to make it perfect."
---
1. Situation
👉 “In the past, while working on projects, I noticed I sometimes spent extra time making things perfect, even if it wasn’t necessary.”
---
2. Task
👉 “My responsibility was to deliver features on time, but my focus on perfection was slowing me down.”
---
3. Action
👉 “To overcome this, I started prioritizing tasks better — first making sure the core functionality works, then improving it step by step. I also began discussing with my manager to confirm what level of detail was needed before starting.”

01:22​ - 1. Can you tell me something about yourself?

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////02:12​ - 2. Why do you want to work here?
✅ STAR Answer (Simple Version)
Situation:
I worked in my last company for about 5 years. I learned many things there — how to code, how to work with teams, and how to handle tasks.

Task:
But I saw that new tools and new technologies are coming in the market. If I stay with only old knowledge, I will not grow.

Action:
So, I started learning new skills and new technologies in my free time. I also improved how I talk with people and share ideas. Then I decided to look for a new role where I can use these new skills.

Result:
Now, I am ready to bring both my past 5 years of experience and my new skills to the next company, so I can do better work and also keep growing.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////6. Why should we hire you?
S (Situation):
In my previous role as a full stack .NET developer, we had a project where performance issues and bugs were delaying releases, and the client was unhappy.

T (Task):
I was responsible for fixing those performance problems, improving code quality, and making sure the product delivered business value on time.

A (Action):

I optimized stored procedures and queries, reducing database response time by 40%.

I used caching and state management in .NET Core and Angular to speed up the application.

I applied clean coding principles (like SOLID, design patterns) so the code became easier for my team to maintain.

I collaborated with testers, used tools like Azure DevOps/Jira for task tracking, and actively participated in Agile ceremonies (scrum, sprint planning, retrospectives).


R (Result):
Because of this, the application performance improved a lot, client satisfaction increased, and we were able to deliver features 2 weeks ahead of schedule.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////05:42​ - 7. Can you tell me about a time when you worked in a team?
🧩 S — Situation (What was happening?)

In my previous project, we were developing a Buy and Sell Property Application using .NET Core and Angular.
Our team had 5 members — 2 backend developers, 2 frontend developers, and 1 tester.
We had a tight deadline to deliver the property listing and booking module in 2 weeks.


---

🎯 T — Task (What was your role?)

My role was to integrate the frontend (Angular) with the backend APIs (.NET Core),
and make sure data like property details, prices, and owner info displayed correctly and updated in real time.


---

⚙️ A — Action (What did you do?)

I started by:

Coordinating daily with the backend team to finalize the API contracts.

Using Postman to test the APIs before integration.

Setting up Angular Interceptors for authentication.

Working closely with the tester to fix data binding and validation issues quickly.

Also helped another developer set up state management using a shared service.
---

🏁 R — Result (What happened finally?)

✅ We delivered the module 2 days before the deadline.
✅ There were zero major bugs during testing.
✅ The manager appreciated our team coordination and clear communication.
✅ This experience taught me how teamwork and open communication speed up delivery.


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////8. How do you handle criticism?
🧩 S – Situation
In one of my previous projects, during a code review, my senior pointed out that my API naming and exception handling could be more consistent with team standards.
---
🎯 T – Task
My task was to take that feedback positively, improve my code quality, and ensure the same mistake didn’t repeat in future development.
---

⚙️ A – Action

I didn’t take it personally — instead, I thanked him for the feedback.
Then I rechecked the project guidelines, updated my APIs as per standards, and added exception middleware for consistent error handling.
Later, I even created a small internal checklist so the team could review their own code before submitting.
---

🏆 R – Result

As a result, not only did my code quality improve, but my senior appreciated my attitude towards learning.
My approach helped reduce repeated review comments in our team and made delivery faster.
