✅ STAR Answer (Simple Version)
Situation:
I worked in my last company for about 5 years. I learned many things there — how to code, how to work with teams, and how to handle tasks.

Task:
But I saw that new tools and new technologies are coming in the market. If I stay with only old knowledge, I will not grow.

Action:
So, I started learning new skills and new technologies in my free time. I also improved how I talk with people and share ideas. Then I decided to look for a new role where I can use these new skills.

Result:
Now, I am ready to bring both my past 5 years of experience and my new skills to the next company, so I can do better work and also keep growing.
