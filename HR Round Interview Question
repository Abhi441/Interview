////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////What are your weaknesses ?
🌟 Example Weakness Answer (STAR Approach)
Weakness Chosen: "Sometimes I used to take more time in solving problems because I wanted to make it perfect."
---
1. Situation
👉 “In the past, while working on projects, I noticed I sometimes spent extra time making things perfect, even if it wasn’t necessary.”
---
2. Task
👉 “My responsibility was to deliver features on time, but my focus on perfection was slowing me down.”
---
3. Action
👉 “To overcome this, I started prioritizing tasks better — first making sure the core functionality works, then improving it step by step. I also began discussing with my manager to confirm what level of detail was needed before starting.”

01:22​ - 1. Can you tell me something about yourself?

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////02:12​ - 2. Why do you want to work here?
✅ STAR Answer (Simple Version)
Situation:
I worked in my last company for about 5 years. I learned many things there — how to code, how to work with teams, and how to handle tasks.

Task:
But I saw that new tools and new technologies are coming in the market. If I stay with only old knowledge, I will not grow.

Action:
So, I started learning new skills and new technologies in my free time. I also improved how I talk with people and share ideas. Then I decided to look for a new role where I can use these new skills.

Result:
Now, I am ready to bring both my past 5 years of experience and my new skills to the next company, so I can do better work and also keep growing.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////05:00​ - 6. Why should we hire you?
S (Situation):
In my previous role as a full stack .NET developer, we had a project where performance issues and bugs were delaying releases, and the client was unhappy.

T (Task):
I was responsible for fixing those performance problems, improving code quality, and making sure the product delivered business value on time.

A (Action):

I optimized stored procedures and queries, reducing database response time by 40%.

I used caching and state management in .NET Core and Angular to speed up the application.

I applied clean coding principles (like SOLID, design patterns) so the code became easier for my team to maintain.

I collaborated with testers, used tools like Azure DevOps/Jira for task tracking, and actively participated in Agile ceremonies (scrum, sprint planning, retrospectives).


R (Result):
Because of this, the application performance improved a lot, client satisfaction increased, and we were able to deliver features 2 weeks ahead of schedule.
