///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////Tell me about your self
"My name is Abhishek, and I have 4 years of experience as a Full Stack .NET Developer, working on end-to-end development of web applications using .NET Core, C#, Web API, Angular, SQL Server, and Azure.
On the backend, I work with .NET Core, EF Core, and Microservices, while on the frontend, I develop using Angular (latest versions), Bootstrap, and TypeScript. I also focus on SQL performance tuning, caching 
strategies, and secure authentication using JWT & OpenID Connect.
In my current project, a Buy & Sell Property Platform, I played a key role in building a real-time chat system with SignalR, a secure payments & transactions module, and admin dashboards with analytics. 
These features increased customer engagement by 30% and reduced manual efforts by 40%, making a direct business impact.
I actively participate in Agile ceremonies like scrum, sprint planning, and retrospectives, and collaborate closely with QA, testers, and DevOps. I also provide inputs on how technical choices
affect business outcomes such as performance, scalability, and customer satisfaction.
Along with development, I continuously upskill myself in system design, cloud (Azure), and performance tuning, and I mentor junior developers on best coding practices, debugging, and testing.
In short, I see myself not just as a developer who writes code, but as a problem-solver who aligns technology with business outcomes. Thatâ€™s the mindset I bring to my work every day."
