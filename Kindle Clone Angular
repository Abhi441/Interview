What is Angular ?
Angular is a component-based framework for building structured, scalable and single page application.
//What is the Angular Advantages ?
1> it is relatively simple to build a single page application.
2> Flexible and structural client application.
3>Angular is cross Plateform and opensourse.
4>Writing Reusable code is easy.
5> Testing is easy.

//What is the diffrence between Angular and Angular JS ? or What are the advantages of Angularover AngularJS ?
 ///Angular js
1> It is only supports javaScript.
2> This framework has a model-view-controller(MVC) architecture.
3>It does have CLI tool.
4>It does not use Dependency Injection.
5> It is not a so fast.

/////Angular
1>It support both JavaScript and TypeScript.
2> This framework has a component archotecture.
3> It has CLI
4> It uses Dependency Injection.
5> It also support moble browser.
6> It is very fast.

Study from File.

What is NPM?
--> NPM(Node Pakage Manager ) is an online repository from where you get thousands of free libraries which can be used in your angular application 

//What is the cli
--> The Angular Cli(command-line interface) is a tool that you use to initialise and deplop Angular applications directly from Terminal.
Asynchrouns operstion :- Task running in the background without stopping the application.

=) what is the role of Angular.json file in Angular
=The angular.json file is the primary configuration file 
for an Angular project.

///////////////////////////Q9)
What is the difference between JIT and AOT in Angular? V. IMP.


Both JIT and AOT are used to compile Angular Typescript components to Javascript, because browser understands Javascript not Typescript.

ANGULAR COMPILE

DETAILS

Just-in-Time (JIT)

Compiles your application in the browser at runtime.

ng serve --configuration development   # Uses JIT

Ahead-of-Time (AOT)


This was the default until Angular 8.

Compiles your application and libraries at build time.

This is the default starting in Angular 9.

All the latest Angular versions use AOT to compile Typescript to Javascript.

Advantage of AOT-Loading in AOT is much quicker than the JIT, because it already has compiled your code at build time.

ng build --configuration production    # Uses AOT

Interview Analogy:

JIT is like cooking food when the guest arrives flexible, but makes them wait.

AOT is like cooking in advance - ready to serve fast.

What is Data Binding in Angular?V. IMP.


Data binding is the way to communicate between your typescript code of your component and html view of component.
What is Data Binding in Angular?



Think of it like a two-way road between logic and UI.


---

üîÑ Types of Data Binding (with simple explanation + example)


---

üîπ 1. Interpolation (One-Way Binding: Component ‚Üí View)
String Interpolation is a one-way data-binding technique that is used to transfer the data from a TypeScript code(component) to an HTML template (view).

String interpolation can work on string type only not numbers or any other type.

2. It is represented inside ({data); double curly braces.

‚û°Ô∏è Show data from TypeScript in HTML using {{ }}.

// app.component.ts
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'Hello Abhishek!';
}

<!-- app.component.html -->
<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

üß† Interview line:

> "Interpolation displays data from the component in the view using double curly braces."




---

üîπ 2. Property Binding (One-Way Binding: Component ‚Üí View)

‚û°Ô∏è Bind a property of an HTML element to a value in the component.

<input [value]="title" />

üß† Interview line:

> "Property binding sets element properties using square brackets []."




---

üîπ 3. Event Binding (One-Way: View ‚Üí Component)
Event binding is used to handle the events raised by the user actions like button click.

‚û°Ô∏è When something happens in the UI (like button click), call a method in TypeScript.

<button (click)="showMessage()">Click Me</button>

showMessage() {
  alert("Hello from Angular!");
}

üß† Interview line:

> "Event binding listens to user actions like clicks and calls a method using ()."




---

üîπ 4. Two-Way Binding (Component ‚áÑ View)

‚û°Ô∏è Sync data in both directions using [(ngModel)].

// app.component.ts
export class AppComponent {
  name = '';
}

<input [(ngModel)]="name" />
<p>Hello {{ name }}</p>

üß† Interview line:

> "Two-way binding uses [(ngModel)] to sync data between the UI and the component."



‚úîÔ∏è Don't forget to import FormsModule in app.module.ts to use ngModel.


---

‚úÖ Final Summary (for interview):

> "Data Binding in Angular connects HTML and TypeScript.
It lets data flow one-way (from component to UI or UI to component), or two-way using ngModel.
Angular supports 4 types: Interpolation, Property Binding, Event Binding, and Two-Way Binding."


/////////////////////////////////////
Absolutely, Abhishek! Here's a clean, human-friendly and interview-ready answer for Q20 to Q26 ‚Äî with examples and simple words so even a non-tech person can understand.


---

‚úÖ Q20. What are Directives in Angular? What are the types?

Answer:

> Directives are instructions in the HTML that tell Angular to do something.



They are used to change the appearance, behavior, or layout of elements in the DOM.


---

‚úÖ Three Types of Directives:

Type	What It Does	Example

1. Component Directive	Custom HTML element (comes with template + logic)	<app-header></app-header>
2. Structural Directive	Changes structure/layout of DOM (adds/removes HTML)	*ngIf, *ngFor, *ngSwitch
3. Attribute Directive	Changes the look or behavior of an element	[ngStyle], [ngClass]



---

‚úÖ Q21. What is *ngIf Structural Directive?

Answer:

> *ngIf is used to show or hide elements based on a condition.



üì¶ Think of it like: "If this is true, show it. If false, hide it."

‚úÖ Example:

<p *ngIf="isLoggedIn">Welcome, Abhishek!</p>

In TypeScript:

isLoggedIn = true;

If isLoggedIn is false, the <p> will not be in the HTML at all.


---

‚úÖ Q22. What is *ngFor Structural Directive?

Answer:

> *ngFor is used to loop through a list and show multiple elements.



üì¶ Think of it like: "For each item in the list, show this block."

‚úÖ Example:

<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let user of users">{{ user }}</li>
</ul>

users = ['Abhishek', 'Raj', 'Kiran'];

This will create 3 <li> items.


---

‚úÖ Q23. What is *ngSwitch Structural Directive?

Answer:

> *ngSwitch is used to switch between views based on a value ‚Äî like a switch-case.



‚úÖ Example:

<div [ngSwitch]="role">
  <p *ngSwitchCase="'admin'">Admin Panel</p>
  <p *ngSwitchCase="'user'">User Dashboard</p>
  <p *ngSwitchDefault>Guest View</p>
</div>

role = 'admin';

It will show "Admin Panel".


---

‚úÖ Q24. What is [ngStyle] Attribute Directive?

Answer:

> ngStyle is used to apply CSS styles dynamically.



‚úÖ Example:

<p [ngStyle]="{ color: isActive ? 'green' : 'red' }">
  Status: {{ isActive ? 'Active' : 'Inactive' }}
</p>

isActive = true;

The <p> text will be green if isActive is true.


---

‚úÖ Q25. What is [ngClass] Attribute Directive?

Answer:

> ngClass is used to add or remove CSS classes dynamically.



‚úÖ Example:

<p [ngClass]="{ 'online': isOnline, 'offline': !isOnline }">
  Connection Status
</p>

.online { color: green; }
.offline { color: red; }

isOnline = true;

The <p> will get class="online" when online.


---

‚úÖ Q26. What is the difference between Component, Structural, and Attribute Directives?

Feature	Component	Structural Directive	Attribute Directive

What it does	Creates a custom UI element	Adds/removes elements	Modifies existing element
Example	<app-user>	*ngIf, *ngFor	[ngStyle], [ngClass]
Template required?	‚úÖ Yes	‚ùå No	‚ùå No
Use case	UI & logic container	Show/hide or repeat HTML	Change CSS, behavior


üß† Analogy:

Component = Your own full widget

Structural = Decides what HTML appears

Attribute = Styles or behaviors applied to HTML

/////////////////////////////////////

Absolutely, Abhishek! Here's a very easy-to-remember, interview-friendly, and code-based explanation for each Angular question (Q27 to Q30 + repeated Q20). Think of these as smart short answers with real understanding.


---

‚úÖ Q27. What is a Decorator in Angular?

> Decorator is a special function in Angular that adds extra features to classes, properties, methods, or parameters.



You‚Äôll see them starting with @ symbol like @Component, @Input, @Injectable.


---

‚úÖ Example:

@Component({
  selector: 'app-user',
  templateUrl: './user.component.html'
})
export class UserComponent {}

üß† This tells Angular:
‚ÄúHey, this class is a component and it has a selector + template.‚Äù


---

‚úÖ Q28. What are the types of Decorators in Angular?

There are 4 main types:

Decorator	Use Case	Example

@Component()	Declares a class as a component	@Component({...})
@Directive()	Declares a custom directive	@Directive({...})
@Injectable()	Marks a class for Dependency Injection	@Injectable()
@Input() / @Output()	For component communication (parent-child)	@Input() name: string;



---

‚úÖ Q29. What are Pipes in Angular?

> Pipes are used to transform data in the template.



üß† Example: Format dates, currency, uppercase/lowercase.


---

‚úÖ Built-in Pipe Example:

<p>{{ today | date:'fullDate' }}</p>

today = new Date();

Output: Wednesday, May 29, 2025


---

‚úÖ Types of Pipes:

Type	Example	Description

Built-in	date, uppercase, currency, json, percent	Already provided by Angular
Custom	You create your own	@Pipe({ name: 'myPipe' })



---

‚úÖ Parameterized Pipe:

> You pass a parameter to the pipe for customization.



‚úÖ Example:

<p>{{ price | currency:'INR':'symbol' }}</p>

Converts number to: ‚Çπ1,000.00


---

‚úÖ Q30. What is Chaining Pipes?

> You can apply multiple pipes together, one after the other.



‚úÖ Example:

<p>{{ name | uppercase | slice:0:4 }}</p>

If name = "abhishek", output = ABHI
(First uppercase, then slice first 4 letters)


---

‚úÖ Q20 (Repeated). What are Directives? Types?

Already answered above, but in short:

> Directives are instructions in the HTML to tell Angular how to behave.




---

Type	Example	Use

Structural	*ngIf, *ngFor	Add/remove elements
Attribute	[ngStyle], [ngClass]	Change look/behavior
Component	@Component()	Custom element



---

üîö Summary Table (Quick Glance)

Feature	Purpose	Example

Decorator	Add metadata to class/property	@Component, @Input
Pipe	Transform data in template	`{{ name
Directive	Control HTML layout/behavior	*ngIf, [ngClass]
