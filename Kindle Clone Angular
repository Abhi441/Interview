What is Angular ?
Angular is a component-based framework for building structured, scalable and single page application.
//What is the Angular Advantages ?
1> it is relatively simple to build a single page application.
2> Flexible and structural client application.
3>Angular is cross Plateform and opensourse.
4>Writing Reusable code is easy.
5> Testing is easy.

//What is the diffrence between Angular and Angular JS ? or What are the advantages of Angularover AngularJS ?
 ///Angular js
1> It is only supports javaScript.
2> This framework has a model-view-controller(MVC) architecture.
3>It does have CLI tool.
4>It does not use Dependency Injection.
5> It is not a so fast.

/////Angular
1>It support both JavaScript and TypeScript.
2> This framework has a component archotecture.
3> It has CLI
4> It uses Dependency Injection.
5> It also support moble browser.
6> It is very fast.

//////////////
Study from File.

What is NPM?
--> NPM(Node Pakage Manager ) is an online repository from where you get thousands of free libraries which can be used in your angular application 

//What is the cli
--> The Angular Cli(command-line interface) is a tool that you use to initialise and deplop Angular applications directly from Terminal.
Asynchrouns operstion :- Task running in the background without stopping the application.

////////////////////////////////Q8)
=) what is the role of Angular.json file in Angular
=The angular.json file is the primary configuration file 
for an Angular project.

///////////////////////////Q9)
What is the difference between JIT and AOT in Angular? V. IMP.


Both JIT and AOT are used to compile Angular Typescript components to Javascript, because browser understands Javascript not Typescript.

ANGULAR COMPILE

DETAILS

Just-in-Time (JIT)

Compiles your application in the browser at runtime.

ng serve --configuration development   # Uses JIT

Ahead-of-Time (AOT)


This was the default until Angular 8.

Compiles your application and libraries at build time.

This is the default starting in Angular 9.

All the latest Angular versions use AOT to compile Typescript to Javascript.

Advantage of AOT-Loading in AOT is much quicker than the JIT, because it already has compiled your code at build time.

ng build --configuration production    # Uses AOT

Interview Analogy:

JIT is like cooking food when the guest arrives flexible, but makes them wait.

AOT is like cooking in advance - ready to serve fast.

What is the diffrence between JIO and AOT in Angular ?

-->Both JIT and Aot are used to compile Angular Typescript component to Javascript , because browser understands Javascript not Typescript.

Just-In-Time(JIT)   Compiles your application in the browser at runtime.

Ahead-of-Time(AOT)  Compile your application and libraries at build time.

What is a Selector and Template
Selector :- A selector is used to identify each component uniquely into the component tree.

What is Data Binding in Angular?V. IMP.


Data binding is the way to communicate between your typescript code of your component and html view of component.
What is Data Binding in Angular?



Think of it like a two-way road between logic and UI.


---

üîÑ Types of Data Binding (with simple explanation + example)


---

üîπ 1. Interpolation (One-Way Binding: Component ‚Üí View)
String Interpolation is a one-way data-binding technique that is used to transfer the data from a TypeScript code(component) to an HTML template (view).

String interpolation can work on string type only not numbers or any other type.

2. It is represented inside ({data); double curly braces.

‚û°Ô∏è Show data from TypeScript in HTML using {{ }}.

// app.component.ts
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'Hello Abhishek!';
}

<!-- app.component.html -->
<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

üß† Interview line:

> "Interpolation displays data from the component in the view using double curly braces."




---

üîπ 2. Property Binding (One-Way Binding: Component ‚Üí View)

‚û°Ô∏è Bind a property of an HTML element to a value in the component.

<input [value]="title" />

üß† Interview line:

> "Property binding sets element properties using square brackets []."




---

üîπ 3. Event Binding (One-Way: View ‚Üí Component)
Event binding is used to handle the events raised by the user actions like button click.

‚û°Ô∏è When something happens in the UI (like button click), call a method in TypeScript.

<button (click)="showMessage()">Click Me</button>

showMessage() {
  alert("Hello from Angular!");
}

üß† Interview line:

> "Event binding listens to user actions like clicks and calls a method using ()."




---

üîπ 4. Two-Way Binding (Component ‚áÑ View)

‚û°Ô∏è Sync data in both directions using [(ngModel)].

// app.component.ts
export class AppComponent {
  name = '';
}

<input [(ngModel)]="name" />
<p>Hello {{ name }}</p>

üß† Interview line:

> "Two-way binding uses [(ngModel)] to sync data between the UI and the component."



‚úîÔ∏è Don't forget to import FormsModule in app.module.ts to use ngModel.


---

‚úÖ Final Summary (for interview):

> "Data Binding in Angular connects HTML and TypeScript.
It lets data flow one-way (from component to UI or UI to component), or two-way using ngModel.
Angular supports 4 types: Interpolation, Property Binding, Event Binding, and Two-Way Binding."

Synchrouns operation :- Task excute one after another and app waits for each task to complete 
moving to the next one.

          ->



Observables                                 Promises

-> Emit multiple value over a          Emit single value over the time
   period of time.


->Are lazy. they're not excuted until          -> excute Immediate after creation
  we subscribe to they  using the subscriptiom

-> have cancell by using unsubcribe.            -> Are not cancelled.


/////////////////////////
RxJx
Rxjs is library of javaScript used in angular for handling asynchrouns data such as Api calls. It provide observables.

////////////////////////
What is observable? How to implement it.
An Observable in RxJx helps us handle data strems like Api response or user input , in a smooth and flexible way.

1> Import Observable from Rxjx.
2> Create the Observable that emits data.
3> Subscribe to the component.

/////////////////////
What is the role of HttpClient in Angular ?
 
Httpclient is build in service provided by angular to http requests(Get , post , put , delect 
to send and receive the data from api or server.

///////////////////////////
What are Angualr Forms ? What are the type of Angualar Forms  ?

->What forms are used to handle user's input and manage form data in an application.
->Two type of Angular form.

Template Driven Forms             
-> Most of the code Written in Html.

-> Add FormModule in AddModule to Activate It.

-> best for simple form and have less control.


  Reactive Forms

-> Most of the code Written in TypeScript file.

-> Add ReactiveModule in AppModule to Activate it.
-> Best for large App Application and have more control.

What is Authentication and Authorization in Angular

Authentication : - Confirms who the user is(valid login or not)
Autherisation :- Check what the user is allowed to do(access control for resourse)
