Q> What is the diffrence between Class and Struct

🔹 Example of a Class (Reference Type)

class Car
{
    public string Brand;
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Car car1 = new Car();
        car1.Brand = "Tesla";

        Car car2 = car1;  // Reference is copied (not a new object)
        car2.Brand = "BMW";

        Console.WriteLine(car1.Brand);  // Output: BMW (same reference)
    }
}

✅ Key Takeaway:

car1 and car2 point to the same object in memory.

Changing car2.Brand also changes car1.Brand.

🔹 Example of a Struct (Value Type)

struct Car
{
    public string Brand;
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Car car1 = new Car();
        car1.Brand = "Tesla";

        Car car2 = car1;  // Copy is created (separate memory)
        car2.Brand = "BMW";

        Console.WriteLine(car1.Brand);  // Output: Tesla (original unchanged)
    }
}

✅ Key Takeaway:

car1 and car2 are separate copies in memory.

Changing car2.Brand does NOT affect car1.Brand.

🔹 Interview-Friendly Answer

1. Class is a reference type (stored in Heap), Struct is a value type (stored in Stack).

2. Class supports inheritance, Struct does not.

3. Class objects are passed by reference, Structs are copied.

4. Use Struct for small, lightweight objects (like Point), and Class for large, complex objects (like Car).

//////////////////////////////Diffrence between Unique key and Foreign key.
Difference Between Unique Key and Foreign Key in SQL

---

🔹 Example of Unique Key

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,  -- Ensures all emails are unique
    Name VARCHAR(50)
);

✅ Key Takeaway:

Email column cannot have duplicate values but can have one NULL.


---

🔹 Example of Foreign Key

CREATE TABLE Departments (
    DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DepartmentName VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    DepartmentID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Departments(DepartmentID)  -- Foreign Key linking to Departments
);

✅ Key Takeaway:

DepartmentID in Employees refers to DepartmentID in Departments table.

Ensures an employee must belong to a valid department.


---

🔹 Interview-Friendly Answer

1. Unique Key ensures uniqueness in a column, Foreign Key links two tables.

2. Unique Key allows one NULL, Foreign Key allows multiple matching values.

3. Unique Key prevents duplicates, Foreign Key ensures referential integrity.

4. Unique Key is used for unique constraints (like emails), Foreign Key is used for table relationships (like Employee-Department).


////////////////////////////////IEnumerable and IQuerable.
Difference Between IEnumerable and IQueryable in C# (Easy Explanation for Interviews)
🔹 Example of IEnumerable (Client-Side Execution, Inefficient for Databases)
List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };

IEnumerable<int> evenNumbers = numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0); // Filters in memory
✅ Key Takeaway:

Loads all data into memory, then filters it.
Bad for large data (wastes memory and performance).
🔹 Example of IQueryable (Database Execution, Efficient for SQL Queries)
using (var context = new MyDbContext())
{
    IQueryable<Employee> employees = context.Employees.Where(e => e.Salary > 50000);
}
✅ Key Takeaway:

Query executes in SQL Server, filtering before data is loaded.
Much faster for large databases.
🔹 Why Use IQueryable for SQL Queries?
Reduces Load on Database: Only fetches required data.
Optimized Queries: Generates efficient SQL (SELECT statements).
Supports Deferred Execution: Query runs only when needed, improving performance.
Scales Better: Ideal for handling large datasets in real applications.
🔹 Interview-Friendly Answer
IEnumerable processes data in memory, IQueryable runs the query on the database.
IEnumerable is better for in-memory collections, IQueryable is best for SQL queries.
IQueryable improves performance by filtering at the database level.
Use IQueryable in Entity Framework to generate efficient SQL queries automatically.

/////////////difference between JIT and AOt
"JIT compiles the code while the app is running, which makes it slower. AOT compiles the code before running the app, making it faster and better for production."
