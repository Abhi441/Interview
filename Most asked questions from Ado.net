Hereâ€™s a curated list of the most frequently asked ADO.NET interview questions for a .NET developer (especially with 3â€“5 years of experience). These are often asked by technical panelists to test your hands-on knowledge, connection handling, and real-world implementation.

âœ… Top ADO.NET Interview Questions

ðŸ”¹ 1. What is ADO.NET?

> ADO.NET is a part of the .NET Framework used to interact with databases like SQL Server. It provides classes to connect, retrieve, insert, update, and delete data.




---

ðŸ”¹ 2. What are the core components of ADO.NET?

> SqlConnection

SqlCommand

SqlDataReader

SqlDataAdapter

DataSet

DataTable





---

ðŸ”¹ 3. What is the difference between ExecuteReader(), ExecuteScalar(), and ExecuteNonQuery()?

Method	Use For	Returns

ExecuteReader()	SELECT query	DataReader object (rows)
ExecuteScalar()	Aggregate (e.g. COUNT)	Single value (first column)
ExecuteNonQuery()	INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE	Number of rows affected



---

ðŸ”¹ 4. How do you use SqlConnection in ADO.NET?

using(SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection("Your_Connection_String"))
{
    conn.Open();
    // Execute commands
}


---

ðŸ”¹ 5. What is SqlDataReader and how does it work?

> Forward-only, read-only way of reading rows.

Very fast and memory efficient.

Used with ExecuteReader().




SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM Employees", conn);
SqlDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader();
while(reader.Read())
{
    var name = reader["Name"].ToString();
}


---

ðŸ”¹ 6. What is the difference between DataReader and DataAdapter?

Feature	DataReader	DataAdapter

Mode	Connected	Disconnected
Usage	Read-only	Fill/update DataSet
Forward only	Yes	No
Best for	Fast reads	Multiple-table datasets



---

ðŸ”¹ 7. What is a DataSet and DataTable?

DataSet: In-memory collection of data tables.

DataTable: Represents one in-memory table.


DataSet ds = new DataSet();
adapter.Fill(ds, "Employees");
DataTable dt = ds.Tables["Employees"];


---

ðŸ”¹ 8. What are Parameterized Queries in ADO.NET? Why are they important?

> Used to prevent SQL Injection and to pass parameters safely.



SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Id = @Id", conn);
cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@Id", userId);


---

ðŸ”¹ 9. What are connection pooling and its benefits?

> ADO.NET maintains a pool of connections to reuse for better performance. It avoids opening/closing DB connections repeatedly.




---

ðŸ”¹ 10. How to handle transactions in ADO.NET?

SqlTransaction transaction = conn.BeginTransaction();
SqlCommand cmd = conn.CreateCommand();
cmd.Transaction = transaction;

try
{
    cmd.CommandText = "INSERT INTO Orders VALUES (...)";
    cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();

    transaction.Commit();
}
catch
{
    transaction.Rollback();
}


---

ðŸ”¹ 11. What is the difference between Fill() and Update() in SqlDataAdapter?

Fill() â†’ Populates a DataSet with data.

Update() â†’ Pushes changes made in DataSet back to the database.



---

ðŸ”¹ 12. How can you call a stored procedure using ADO.NET?

SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("sp_GetUser", conn);
cmd.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure;
cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@UserId", 1);


---

ðŸ”¹ 13. What are the different CommandType values in ADO.NET?

Text â†’ SQL query

StoredProcedure â†’ Procedure call

TableDirect â†’ Select all from table (rarely used)



---

ðŸ”¹ 14. What are some best practices when using ADO.NET?

Always use using() blocks.

Use parameterized queries.

Close connections in finally block.

Handle exceptions properly.

Avoid unnecessary DataSet use if only one table is needed.
