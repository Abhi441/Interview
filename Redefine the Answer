RxJx
Rxjs is library of javaScript used in angular for handling asynchrouns data such as Api calls. It provide observables.

////////////////////////
What is observable? How to implement it.
An Observable in RxJx helps us handle data strems like Api response or user input , in a smooth and flexible way.

1> Import Observable from Rxjx.
2> Create the Observable that emits data.
3> Subscribe to the component.

What is Inheritance and why is it Important


->Inheritance is a OOPs concept , child class gets the properties from and behaviors(methods) of a parent class. 

-> Inheritance is used to reusibility and abtraction of code.

Example :
public class Employee
{
public Employee()
{
  //
}
 private int salary;
 
 public class Salary
{
  get
 {
   return experience;
 }
 set
  {
  experience = value ;
 }
}
}


class ContractEmplyee : Employee
  public void CalculateSalary()
 {
  int salary = Experience * 300000 ;
  }

  Console.WriteLine(salary);
  
}


///////////////////////////////////////////
What are type of Inheritance

//////////////////////////////////////
What are the Diffrent type of Inheritance.

1>Single Inheritance
one child class inheritance from one parent class

class Parent
{
public void Show()
{
 Console.WriteLine("This is Parent class");
}

}

class Child : Parent
{
 // child inheritance from parent
}

class Program
{
 static void Main()
 {
  Child obj = new Child();
  obj.Show();
}
}

2> Multilevel Inheritance

A Child class inherits from Parent, and Parent inherits from GrandParent

class GrandParent
{
 public void ShowGrandParent()
{
  Console.WriteLine("GrandParent class");
}

class Parent : GrandParent
{
 public void ShowParent()
{
 Console.WriteLine("Parent class";)
}
}


class Child : Parent
{
 public void ShowParent()
 {
  Console.WriteLine("");
 }
}
class Program
{
 static void Main()
{
 Child obj = new Child();
 obj.ShowGrandParent();
obj.ShowParent();
obj.ShowChild();
}
}

3>One Parent class is get inherited by multiple Child classes

class Employee
{
  public void Work()
 {
   Console.WriteLine("Employee working");
 }
}

class ContractEmplyee : Employee
{
  public void ContractType()
 {
  Console.WriteLine("Contract Employee")
 }
}

class ParmanentEmployee : Employee
{
  public void PermanentType()
  {
   Console.WriteLine("Permanent Employee");
  } 
}

class Program
{
 static void main()
 {
  ContractEmplyee cEmp = new ContractEmplyee();
   cEmp.Work();
   cEmp.ContractType();

  PermanemtEmplyee pEmp = new PermanentEmplyee();
   pEmp.Work();
   pEmp.PermanentType();
 }
}


///////////////////////////////////////////////////
What is Abtraction
Abraction is oops concept , it will show the important part and hide the implementation part ,
    let take the example when we  give exlerate of bike speed to bike will increase but we do
    not know how the speed of bike is increasing

class Employee
{
    public void Main(string[] args)
    {

        Salary();
    }

    public  void Salary()
    {
        ContactEmployeeSalary();
        ParmantEmplyeeSalary();
    }

    public  void ContactEmployeeSalary()
    {
        
    }
    public  void ParmantEmplyeeSalary()
    {
        
    }
}

/////////////////////////////////////
What is Encapsulation
Encapsulation is oops concept , it is used to wrap the data method and property into single units.

example

public class Employee
{
public class EmExperience;

public int Employee
{
 get
{
 return emExperience;
}
 get
{
 emExperience = value;
}
}

public void Main(string[] args)
{
 Employee obj = new Employee();
 
 obj.EmExperience = 3;
 
}


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
what is Abstraction.

👉 Abstraction is an OOP concept that hides unnecessary details and only shows important parts to the user.

Example:
When you accelerate a bike, the speed increases, but you don’t see how the engine works internally.
The complexity is hidden, and only the important part (speed control) is visible.

How do we achieve Abstraction in C#?
✔ Using abstract classes (with abstract methods).
✔ Using interface (where methods are declared but not defined).

Example Code in C#:
csharp
Copy
Edit
// Abstract class: Defines common structure but hides implementation
abstract class Employee  
{  
    public abstract void CalculateSalary();  // Only method definition (no implementation)  

    public void ShowDetails()  
    {  
        Console.WriteLine("Showing Employee Details");  
    }  
}  

// Permanent Employee class implements its own salary calculation
class PermanentEmployee : Employee  
{  
    public override void CalculateSalary()  
    {  
        Console.WriteLine("Salary = HoursWorked * HourlyRate");  
    }  
}

// Contract Employee class implements a different salary calculation
class ContractEmployee : Employee  
{  
    public override void CalculateSalary()  
    {  
        Console.WriteLine("Salary = (HoursWorked * HourlyRate) - 4000");  
    }  
}

// Main Program
class Program  
{  
    static void Main()  
    {  
        Employee emp1 = new PermanentEmployee();  
        emp1.CalculateSalary();  // Output: Salary = HoursWorked * HourlyRate  
        emp1.ShowDetails();  

        Employee emp2 = new ContractEmployee();  
        emp2.CalculateSalary();  // Output: Salary = (HoursWorked * HourlyRate) - 4000  
    }  
}


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
What is Encapsulation

Q: What is Encapsulation?
👉 Encapsulation is an OOP concept that wraps data (variables) and methods (functions) inside a single unit (class).
👉 It hides the data from direct access and provides controlled access using getter and setter methods.

✅ Corrected Example in C#:
csharp
Copy
Edit
public class Employee
{
    private int empExperience;  // Private variable (cannot be accessed directly)

    // Public property with getter and setter
    public int EmpExperience
    {
        get 
        { 
            return empExperience;  
        }
        set 
        { 
            if (value > 0) // Prevents negative experience
                empExperience = value;  
            else
                Console.WriteLine("Experience cannot be negative");  
        }
    }
}

// Main Program
class Department
{
    static void Main(string[] args)  // Fixed the typo in Main()
    {
        Employee emp = new Employee();  
        emp.EmpExperience = 3;  // Setting the experience
        Console.WriteLine("Employee Experience: " + emp.EmpExperience);  // Getting the experience
    }
}

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////Polymorphism



Polymorphism is oops concept , poly means many and form means form , it will behave diffrent in diffrent place .

The word "Run" can be used in different contexts:
1️⃣ "Running a business"(managing it)
2️⃣ "Running a bike"(riding it)

     -> we have two type of polymorphism 
    1> overloading : In overloading method have the same name in the same class and all the method work diffrently ways. It will happen at compiletime.
    2> overriding  : In overriding  method have the same name and signature but in the diffrent class . it will happen at Runtime.

    or
     Types of Polymorphism in C#:
1️⃣ Method Overloading (Compile-Time Polymorphism)

The same method name is used with different parameters in the same class.

This is resolved at compile time.

2️⃣ Method Overriding(Runtime Polymorphism)

A child class provides a new implementation of a method already present in the parent class.

This happens at runtime.


// Overloading
    class Calculator
{
    // Same method name but different parameters
    public int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }

    public int Add(int a, int b, int c)
    {
        return a + b + c;
    }

    public double Add(double a, double b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        Console.WriteLine(calc.Add(5, 10));      // Calls method with 2 parameters
        Console.WriteLine(calc.Add(5, 10, 15));  // Calls method with 3 parameters
        Console.WriteLine(calc.Add(5.5, 10.5));  // Calls method with double parameters
    }
}

// Overrinding
class BaseClass
{
    public virtual void Greet()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Welcome from Base Class!");
    }
}

class SubClass : BaseClass
{
    public override void Greet()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Welcome from Sub Class!");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        BaseClass obj = new SubClass();
        obj.Greet();  // Calls the overridden method from SubClass
    }
}

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////

WHEN TO USE INTERFACE AND WHEN ABSTRACT CLASS? :::



Abstarction: -
--> common Property / behavior to all the derived class.
--> when we need property, feild, method, contructor.
--> when we want that implementation of method in the same way then go for abstraction.

abstract public Employee
{
    public abstract void CalculateSalary(); 
    
   public void CalculateSalary()
   {
    Console.WriteLine("Tax calculation");
   }
}
Interface: -

--> when you want multiple inheritance achieve then go for Intrface,
--> when you go for contract.
--> when we want loosely coupled thing.
--> 
interface emEmployee
{ 
  void play();
}




///////////////////////////////////////////////
What is Nullable type Nullable type is used to store null values;
this is useful when you want to represent a value that may or may not be present.

using System;
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        int? a = null;
        Console.WriteLine(a);
    }
}





/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////What is the Constructor and type.
--> A Constructor is a special method in a class that is automatically called when we create an object.

--> It is mainly used to initialize the object.

--> The constructor name is same as the class name and it has no return type.

--> Application
1> Initializing the objects with default or required data.
2>Dependency Injection


1> Default Constructor
-->No parameters.
-->Automatically initizes object when no value is passes.

Application
Frameworks like Entity Framework require a parameterless constructor for mapping.

example

public class Product
{
public int Id {get; set ;}
public string Name {get ; set ;}

// Default construction for EF or serialization
public Product()
{
}
}

2> Parameterized Constructor
-> Takes parameter to set values when object is created.

Application 
Dependency Injection., Injecting services in ASP.Net Core
Example
public class OrderServices
{
 private readonly IOrderRepository _repository;

 public OrderService(IOrderRepository repository)
{
 _repository = repository;
}
}

3> Static Constructor
-> Used to initialize static member of the class.
-> Called only once, automatically, when the class is first used.

use : When you want to initialize static data, like connection strings, only once before the class is used. ex : Loading configuration.

Example
public class ConfigManager
{
pulic static string ConnectionString;
static ConfigManager()
{
  ConnectionString = "Server=MyServer";
}
}

4> Private Constructor
   -> Used when we want to restrict the object creation fro  outside.
   -> Mostly used in Singleton Desigb Pattern.
   -> Cannot be inherited.

example:
public class Logger
{
 private static Logger _instance;
 private Logger() {} // Private constructor

 public static Logger GetInstance()
{
   if(_instance == null)
{
  _instance = new Logger();
}
return _instance;
}
}


///////////////////////Generic
What are Generics in C#?

Generics allow us to create classes, methods, and interfaces that work with any data type in a type-safe way.

Instead of writing the same code for different types (like int, string, etc.), we write it once using generics — and it will work for any type.

Why and When to Use Generics?
Type safety – No need for casting.

Code reusability – Write one method for all data types.

Performance – Avoids boxing/unboxing (in value types).

Clean and maintainable code.

using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        bool isEqual = Calculator.AreEqual<int>(10, 10);
        bool isStrEqual = Calculator.AreEqual<string>("Hello", "Hello");

        Console.WriteLine("Int equal: " + isEqual);
        Console.WriteLine("String equal: " + isStrEqual);
    }
}

public class Calculator
{
    public static bool AreEqual<T>(T a, T b)
    {
        return a.Equals(b);
    }
}

What is the diffrence between arr and arralist :::

Array

-->Arrays is fixed in size.
-->Arrays are strongly typed.
-->better in performance because typed is Known at compile time.

EXample Array
class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        int[] array = new int[10];
        array[0] = 1;
        array[1] = 2;
    }
}

ArrayList

-->Arraylist is not in fixed size.
-->Arraylist is not strongly typed.
--> Arraylist is not better in performance because it is not strongly typed.

EXample Arratlist

class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        ArrayList ar = new ArrayList();
        ar.Add(1);
        ar.Add(2);
    }
}

///////////////////////////////////////
using System;

What is the Imumerable in c# :::
--> IEnumerable is an interface in C# that allows us to loop through a collection using a foreach loop.
--> It works internally with IEnumerator, which moves one item at a time.
--> When we use IEnumerable, it pulls data one by one — not all at once in memory.
--> It is useful for read-only access to a collection.


when to use:

--> When you just want to iterate (loop) through a collection like List, Array, Dictionary, etc.
--> Ideal when you don’t need to modify the collection.
--> You can use LINQ with it (Where, Select, etc.).

example
class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] agts)
    {
        var employee = new List<Employee>()
        {
            new Employee() { ID = 1, Name = "John", Salary = 1000 },
            new Employee() { ID = 2, Name = "Jane", Salary = 2000 }
        };
        foreach(var emp in employee)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"ID: {emp.ID}, Name: {emp.Name}, Salary: {emp.Salary}");
        }
    }
}

public class Employee
{
    public int ID { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public double Salary { get; set; }
}

--> IEnumerable is lazy - loaded — it fetches data only when you access it. This is great for performance 
    when dealing with large datasets.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


What is the diffrence betwenn Inumerator and Inumerable :::

    IEnumerable
    -- > It represents a collection that can be iterated (looped) using foreach.
    -- > It has one method: GetEnumerator(), which returns an IEnumerator

    IEnumerable<string> fruits = new List<string> { "Apple", "Banana" };

IEnumerator

    It is used to loop through each item one by one in a collection
    It has two main methods:

MoveNext() → moves to next item

Current → gives the current item

    Real-Life Analogy:
IEnumerable = TV Remote(it lets you go through channels)

IEnumerator = Finger that presses Next button (moves from one channel to another)

    using System;
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        List<string> colors = new List<string> { "Red", "Green", "Blue" };

        IEnumerable<string> enumerable = colors;
        IEnumerator<string> enumerator = enumerable.GetEnumerator();

        while (enumerator.MoveNext())
        {
            Console.WriteLine(enumerator.Current);
        }
    }
}

Final One-Liner (For Interview):
"IEnumerable represents the whole collection, and IEnumerator is the tool that moves through each item in that collection."


/////////////////////////////////////////////
what is Extensition Methods :::
An extension method is a static method in a static class that uses the this keyword before the first parameter to
extend the functionality of an existing type without modifying the original type

public static class IntExtensition
{
    public static int DoubleIt(this int number)
    {
        return number * 2;
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int x = 5;
        int result = x.DoubleIt();// Calls the extensitiom method
        Console.WriteLine(result); // Output: 10
    }

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////How to handle the error in Asp.netcore.

Global- Error Handling - so the whole app doesn't crash:

if(app.Enviroment.IsDevelopment())
{
app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();//Show detailed error in development;
}
else
{
 app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");//Show friendly erro page in Production.
}

Try-catch Block -for specific code
try
{

}
catch(Exception ex)
{
_logger.LogError(ex,"Something went wrong.");
return StatusCode(500, "An error occured.");
}

-> Global error handling saves the full app.
-> Try-Catch handles errors in specific code blocks.
-> Logging helps us track the issue.
