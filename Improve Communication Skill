//////////////
Instead --> We use instead when we choose option over another - especially to show replacement or an alternative.
//
Basic Structure: Option A didn't happen -> Instead, Option B happened.
Example : We didn't use a third-party library for validation.Instead , we wrote a custom validation service.

/////////////
"Once" means after something happens or as soon as something is done.
It shows as sequesce or condition.
//
once + [event happens], [do something next].
Example : Once  the code is reviewed, we will deploy it to production.

/////////////////
Use Overall.











































































////////////////////////My Mistack
Instead of basically...basically -> Use "Intially" , "At first" , "Then" , "Eventually".

///////////////////////
We Sit Together -> we decided to sit down and discuss.

//////////////////////Avoid repeating "we have" multiple times ->
Mix it with we did, we ensured , we implemented.
