My Friend: DSA is tough.
Me: Not for me. I follow the 3-7-15 Rule. 
But let me be honest —
It wasn’t always this way.
I used to forget what I solved just a week ago.
The problem wasn’t practice.
It was retention.
That’s when I created the 3-7-15 Rule 👇

Solve a question 4 times:
✅ First time — Understand and solve it
✅ After 3 days — Solve it again to remember
✅ After 7 days — Solve it once more to get better
✅ After 15 days — Solve it one last time to make it stick in your mind
By the 4th time, your brain stops panicking.
You recognize patterns instantly.

🧠 Understanding .NET Memory Management – A Must-Have Skill for Every Developer

Memory management in .NET is one of those behind-the-scenes topics that often gets overlooked—until it starts causing real problems in production.

Whether you're just starting out or have years of experience, knowing how .NET handles memory can help you write cleaner, more efficient, and more reliable code.

🔹 So, what exactly happens under the hood?

.NET uses a Garbage Collector (GC) to manage memory automatically. It allocates memory for your objects on the managed heap and periodically clears up unused ones. But it’s not magic—GC only collects objects that are no longer referenced.

🔹 The heap is divided into three generations:
Gen 0: Short-lived objects (like local variables)
Gen 1: Medium lifespan
Gen 2: Long-lived objects (like app-wide caches)


💡 Real-scenario:

In one of our enterprise applications, we noticed performance degradation after each deployment. Initially, the app was responsive, but over time, it slowed down significantly—even without any increase in load.

After some profiling, we found the culprit: unsubscribed event handlers.

A background service was subscribing to an event but never unsubscribing, keeping large objects alive in memory even though they were no longer needed.

 The Garbage Collector couldn’t clean them up because references still existed.

✅ The fix? We implemented proper event unsubscription and moved to WeakReference where appropriate. Memory usage stabilized, and performance improved noticeably.


🔍 Key Takeaways:

Always dispose unmanaged resources (IDisposable, using)
Unsubscribe from events when no longer needed
Avoid static references to large objects
Use memory profiling tools like dotMemory, Visual Studio Diagnostics, or JetBrains Rider


📣 To freshers: Start developing good habits early. Learn about GC, and avoid memory leaks before they happen.

📣 To experienced devs: Don’t assume GC will solve everything. Real-time monitoring and profiling are your best friends.

Let’s build .NET apps that are not just functional—but also smart and sustainable. 🔧

𝐀𝐝𝐝𝐒𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐥𝐞𝐭𝐨𝐧 vs 𝐀𝐝𝐝𝐒𝐜𝐨𝐩𝐞𝐝 vs 𝐀𝐝𝐝𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭 in C# Dependency Injection
Do you really know the difference? 

Whenever a service is requested, the DI Container must decide:
 ➡️ Create a new instance?
 ➡️ Or reuse an existing one?

That decision depends on the lifetime defined when you register the service.
Here’s a quick refresher:
𝐀𝐝𝐝𝐒𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐥𝐞𝐭𝐨𝐧
• A single instance is created the first time it's requested (or during ConfigureServices if specified).
• The same instance is used throughout the application's lifetime.

𝐀𝐝𝐝𝐒𝐜𝐨𝐩𝐞𝐝
• A new instance is created once per request.
• Ideal for web apps where services share state per HTTP request.

𝐀𝐝𝐝𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭
• A new instance every time the service is requested.
• Best for lightweight, stateless operations.

When to Use What?
✔️ Use Transient for short-lived, stateless services.
 ✔️ Use Scoped when you want to maintain state within a request.
 ✔️ Use Singleton for app-wide services like logging, caching, and configuration.

Making the right choice can improve performance and prevent memory issues.

 What’s your default choice and why? Let’s discuss!

🎯 Top .NET Core MVC Interview Questions Asked by TCS, Infosys, Accenture, Capgemini, LTI, Cognizant, Deloitte & More!


✅ 1–10: Basics of .NET Core MVC
1. What is .NET Core and how is it different from .NET Framework?
2. What is ASP.NET Core MVC?
3. What is Middleware in .NET Core?
4. What is the role of Startup.cs file in ASP.NET Core?
5. What is the use of appsettings.json? How do you read values from it?
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////6. What is the difference between IActionResult and ActionResult<T>?
 1️⃣ Definition (in easiest words)

IActionResult → It is an interface that represents the result of an action method (like Ok(), NotFound(), BadRequest() etc.).
✅ You use it when your action can return multiple result types.

ActionResult<T> → It is a generic version of ActionResult that can return both a specific data type (T) and HTTP status results like Ok() or NotFound().
✅ You use it when your action returns data (like a model or DTO) and also status codes.



---

🧠 2️⃣ Example

Using IActionResult

[HttpGet("{id}")]
public IActionResult GetProperty(int id)
{
    var property = _propertyService.GetPropertyById(id);
    
    if (property == null)
        return NotFound(); // 404

    return Ok(property); // 200 with data
}

Here, you return Ok() or NotFound(), both are different IActionResults.


---

Using ActionResult<T>

[HttpGet("{id}")]
public ActionResult<PropertyDto> GetProperty(int id)
{
    var property = _propertyService.GetPropertyById(id);

    if (property == null)
        return NotFound(); // 404

    return property; // automatically wraps in Ok()
}

Here, ActionResult<PropertyDto> can return either:

PropertyDto → data with 200 status, or

NotFound() → 404 status.


So, it’s type-safe and cleaner.


---

💼 3️⃣ Project Use (Buy & Sell Property App)

In your Buy & Sell Property Application,
you can use:

IActionResult when you want to just return status — for example:

[HttpPost]
public IActionResult DeleteProperty(int id)
{
    bool deleted = _propertyService.Delete(id);
    if (!deleted)
        return NotFound();
    return NoContent();
}

ActionResult<PropertyDto> when you want to return property details or error:

[HttpGet("{id}")]
public ActionResult<PropertyDto> GetProperty(int id)
{
    var property = _propertyService.GetById(id);
    if (property == null)
        return NotFound("Property not found");
    return property;
}



---

⚖️ 4️⃣ Trade-offs

Feature IActionResult ActionResult<T>

Return data with type safety ❌ No ✅ Yes
Return multiple types (OK, NotFound) ✅ Yes ✅ Yes
Easy unit testing ❌ Less easy ✅ Easier (strongly typed)
Modern ASP.NET Core practice ⚠️ Legacy style ✅ Recommended



---

💡 5️⃣ Business Impact

✅ Makes API responses consistent and predictable
✅ Improves client integration (Angular or React apps get clear data types)
✅ Reduces runtime errors, increasing stability and maintainability
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////7. Explain the MVC architecture and how it works in ASP.NET Core.

Perfect, Abhishek 👏

Here’s how you can explain MVC architecture in ASP.NET Core confidently in an interview for a 7 years experienced .NET full stack developer — with clear technical points + real-world explanation 👇


---

🧩 Definition (Simple + Professional)

MVC stands for Model–View–Controller — it’s an architectural design pattern used to separate an application into 3 main parts:

1. Model → Handles the data and business logic.


2. View → Handles the UI (what user sees).


3. Controller → Handles user input and connects Model and View.



It helps in separation of concerns, easy testing, and better maintainability.


---

⚙️ How It Works (Flow)

Let’s see how MVC works step-by-step in ASP.NET Core:

1. User Request → Controller

A user types a URL or clicks a button.

The request first goes to the Controller.

Example: PropertyController.



2. Controller → Model

The controller asks the Model (C# classes) to get or update data from the database via Entity Framework / ADO.NET.

Example: PropertyService.GetAllProperties().



3. Model → Database → Model

The model fetches data (like property listings or user details) and returns it to the controller.



4. Controller → View

The controller passes this data to the View (a .cshtml page).

Example: return View(propertyList);



5. View → User

The view displays the data in a user-friendly format — HTML + Razor syntax.





---

🏠 Project Use (Buy & Sell Properties App)

In your Property Buy & Sell Application:

Model: Property, User, Transaction classes — these represent tables in the database.

View: Razor pages showing property listings, details, and dashboards.

Controller: PropertyController, AccountController, etc., handle user actions (buy, sell, search).


📘 Example:

public class PropertyController : Controller
{
    private readonly IPropertyService _service;

    public PropertyController(IPropertyService service)
    {
        _service = service;
    }

    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        var properties = _service.GetAllProperties();
        return View(properties);
    }
}


---

⚖️ Trade-offs

Advantage Disadvantage

Easy to maintain and test due to separation of concerns Can be overkill for very small apps
Multiple developers can work in parallel (UI, Business, DB) More files and structure to manage
Promotes clean architecture Requires understanding of request flow



---

💼 Business Impact

✅ Faster development in large teams
✅ Better code organization → fewer bugs
✅ Easy to extend — e.g., adding new modules like Payments or Notifications without breaking old ones
✅ Improves scalability and maintainability

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////8. What is Dependency Injection in ASP.NET Core?

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////9. What are the different types of dependency injection lifetimes?
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////10. What is the use of ConfigureServices and Configure methods?
Definition (Simple + Technical)

In ASP.NET Core, the Startup class (or in .NET 6/7/8 the Program.cs file) has two main methods:

🔹 ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)

Used to register services that your app will use (like dependency injection setup).

Example: adding database contexts, authentication, logging, caching, etc.

Basically, you tell .NET what you’ll need in your app.


🔹 Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)

Used to configure the HTTP request pipeline.

This defines how a request travels through middleware (e.g., logging → authentication → routing → controller).

Basically, you tell .NET how to handle every request.



---

💻 2️⃣ Example Code (.NET 8 minimal setup)

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// ConfigureServices equivalent
builder.Services.AddControllers();
builder.Services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>();
builder.Services.AddAuthentication();
builder.Services.AddMemoryCache();

var app = builder.Build();

// Configure equivalent
if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
}

app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();
app.MapControllers();

app.Run();

In older versions (.NET 5 or lower), this same logic was split into the Startup.cs file with both ConfigureServices and Configure methods.


---

🏢 3️⃣ Project Use — Buy & Sell Properties App

In your Buy & Sell Properties Application:

In ConfigureServices, you can register:

services.AddDbContext<PropertyDbContext>();
services.AddScoped<IPropertyService, PropertyService>();
services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
        .AddJwtBearer(...);
services.AddCors(options => { ... });

In Configure, you can define:

app.UseCors("AllowSpecificOrigin");
app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();
app.MapControllers();


✅ So, when a user sends a request (like /api/properties), it passes through: CORS → Authentication → Authorization → Controller → Response.


---

⚖️ 4️⃣ Trade-offs

Pros Cons

Clean separation of service setup and pipeline Must understand middleware order carefully
Highly testable and maintainable Mistakes in configuration can break authentication/routing
Easy dependency injection Complex in large apps if not organized



---

💼 5️⃣ Business Impact

Makes your app scalable and configurable without rewriting code.

Helps manage features like authentication, logging, and CORS easily.

In large apps (like your Buy/Sell platform), it ensures smooth communication between frontend (Angular) and backend (.NET) via consistent middleware setup.



---

✅ Interview Short Answer:

> "ConfigureServices is used to register dependencies and app services like DB, caching, and authentication.
Configure is used to define how requests are handled through middleware like routing, authentication, and exception handling.
Together, they define the setup and execution flow of a .NET Core app."

Custom routing in ASP.NET Core MVC means defining your own URL patterns instead of using the default ones.

By default, ASP.NET Core uses this route pattern:

/{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}

But in custom routing, we can create meaningful URLs like:

/buy/property/101  
/sell/property/new

This helps in SEO, user readability, and better organization.


---

⚙️ Code Example – Custom Route Definition

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddControllersWithViews();
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        if (env.IsDevelopment())
            app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();

        app.UseRouting();

        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
            // ✅ Custom Route 1: For Property Details
            endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
                name: "propertyDetails",
                pattern: "property/details/{id:int}",
                defaults: new { controller = "Property", action = "Details" });

            // ✅ Custom Route 2: For Admin Dashboard
            endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
                name: "adminRoute",
                pattern: "admin/dashboard",
                defaults: new { controller = "Admin", action = "Dashboard" });

            // ✅ Default Route
            endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
                name: "default",
                pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
        });
    }
}


---

🏗 Project Use — Buy & Sell Property Application

In your Buy & Sell Property App,
you can use custom routing for:

/buy/property/{id} → For buyer property details

/admin/manage/users → For admin panel management

/seller/dashboard → For seller login area


Example:

endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
    name: "buyerProperty",
    pattern: "buy/property/{id:int}",
    defaults: new { controller = "Property", action = "Details" });

✅ It makes URLs clean, SEO-friendly, and easier for users to remember.


---

⚖️ Trade-offs

Advantage Disadvantage

Custom URLs improve SEO and readability You must maintain consistency for all custom routes
Helps in organizing complex modules Complex apps need route versioning/testing
Improves security by hiding real controller/action names Slightly more configuration overhead



---

💼 Business Impact

Clean URLs improve user experience and search engine ranking.

Helps customers find properties faster via shareable links.

Reduces confusion for marketing and analytics tracking.



---

🎯 Interview-Ready Summary

> “In my project, we define custom routes in Startup.cs using MapControllerRoute.
For example, in our Buy & Sell Property app, we have routes like /buy/property/{id} for buyers and /admin/dashboard for admins.
It improves SEO, gives clean URLs, and helps in modular structure of the app.”
