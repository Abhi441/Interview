/////////////////// Different between DIStinct and unique

### 1. `DISTINCT`

The `DISTINCT` keyword is used in the `SELECT` statement to remove duplicate rows from the result set. It ensures that the result set contains only unique rows.

**Example:**

Consider the following `Employees` table:

| ID  | Name    | Department |
|-----|---------|------------|
| 1   | John    | HR         |
| 2   | Alice   | IT         |
| 3   | Bob     | HR         |
| 4   | John    | HR         |
| 5   | Alice   | Finance    |

To get unique names from this table, you can use the `DISTINCT` keyword:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Name FROM Employees;
```

**Result:**

| Name  |
|-------|
| John  |
| Alice |
| Bob   |

In this case, `DISTINCT` eliminates duplicate names from the result set.

### 2. `UNIQUE`

The `UNIQUE` constraint is used to ensure that all values in a column are different. This constraint ensures that no duplicate values are entered into a specific column.

**Example:**

Consider you want to make sure that the `Email` column in the `Employees` table contains only unique email addresses. You can define the table with a `UNIQUE` constraint on the `Email` column.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Department VARCHAR(50),
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
```

Now, if you try to insert duplicate email addresses, the database will throw an error.

```sql
-- Inserting a new record
INSERT INTO Employees (ID, Name, Department, Email)
VALUES (1, 'John', 'HR', 'john@example.com');

-- Attempting to insert a duplicate email
INSERT INTO Employees (ID, Name, Department, Email)
VALUES (2, 'Alice', 'IT', 'john@example.com');
```

The second `INSERT` statement will fail because the email `john@example.com` already exists.

### Practical Example in a SQL Environment

Let's consider another practical example:

#### Table: `Sales`

| OrderID | Product  | Quantity | Price |
|---------|----------|----------|-------|
| 1       | Laptop   | 1        | 1000  |
| 2       | Laptop   | 1        | 1000  |
| 3       | Mouse    | 2        | 20    |
| 4       | Keyboard | 1        | 50    |
| 5       | Mouse    | 2        | 20    |

#### Using `DISTINCT`

To get unique product names from the `Sales` table:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Product FROM Sales;
```

**Result:**

| Product  |
|----------|
| Laptop   |
| Mouse    |
| Keyboard |

#### Using `UNIQUE` Constraint

Suppose we want to ensure that each `OrderID` in the `Sales` table is unique:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Sales (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Product VARCHAR(50),
    Quantity INT,
    Price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    UNIQUE (OrderID)
);
```

This constraint ensures that no two orders can have the same `OrderID`.

### Summary

- **`DISTINCT`**: Used in `SELECT` statements to remove duplicate rows from the result set.
- **`UNIQUE`**: A constraint applied to a column to ensure that all values in that column are different.

Understanding these concepts will help you manage and query your database more effectively.



///////////////////In a table if it's tell 69 distinct and4 unique value wat does it means


When a table has 69 distinct values and 4 unique values, it means the following:

### Distinct Values
- **69 Distinct Values**: This refers to the number of unique entries in the column, ignoring duplicates. In other words, if you use the `DISTINCT` keyword in a `SELECT` statement for that column, you will get 69 different entries.

### Unique Values
- **4 Unique Values**: This refers to the number of entries in the column that appear only once. These are the values that do not have any duplicates in the column.

### Example

Let's clarify with an example. Consider the following `Employees` table with a `Department` column:

| ID  | Name    | Department |
|-----|---------|------------|
| 1   | John    | HR         |
| 2   | Alice   | IT         |
| 3   | Bob     | HR         |
| 4   | John    | HR         |
| 5   | Alice   | Finance    |
| 6   | Carol   | IT         |
| 7   | Dave    | Marketing  |
| 8   | Eve     | Marketing  |
| 9   | Frank   | Marketing  |
| 10  | Grace   | IT         |

In this small example:

- The distinct values in the `Department` column are: `HR`, `IT`, `Finance`, `Marketing`. There are 4 distinct values.

Now, let's expand this concept to a larger dataset where there are 69 distinct values and 4 unique values.

### Hypothetical Example

Consider a `Products` table with the following `Category` column:

| ProductID | Category   |
|-----------|------------|
| 1         | Electronics|
| 2         | Clothing   |
| 3         | Grocery    |
| 4         | Electronics|
| 5         | Furniture  |
| ...       | ...        |
| 1000      | Toys       |

Assume this table has 1000 rows.

- **Distinct Values**: If we perform a `SELECT DISTINCT Category FROM Products`, we find there are 69 different categories of products.
- **Unique Values**: If we check for values that appear only once, we find there are 4 categories that have exactly one product associated with them.

### SQL Queries to Illustrate

To find the distinct values:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Category FROM Products;
```

To count the distinct values:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Category) FROM Products;
```
This will return `69`.

To find the unique values:
```sql
SELECT Category
FROM Products
GROUP BY Category
HAVING COUNT(*) = 1;
```

To count the unique values:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM (
    SELECT Category
    FROM Products
    GROUP BY Category
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
) AS UniqueCategories;
```
This will return `4`.

### Summary
- **69 Distinct Values**: There are 69 different categories in the `Category` column.
- **4 Unique Values**: There are 4 categories that appear only once in the `Category` column.

Understanding these terms helps in data analysis by giving insights into the diversity and distribution of the data in a particular column.
